# Ticket Manager Application
 
 This is a simple application for ticket management using primarily ReactJS, NodeJS and Bootstrap. This application will still have changes and improvements, but its main function is already functional.
 
 # Get Started
 
  The application is divided in backend and frontend, both having their own package.json file. For that, it is necessary to run the command "npm i" inside both folders to install all the dependecies for the frontend and the backend.
